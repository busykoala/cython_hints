# Cython Hints

This package demonstrates some usefull cases how to use cython.

## Where to find what

In `demo_module` I do stuff with converting python code to C and using
standard library functions.

In `demo_module_two` I use functions from own C code beeing shipped with
the package. Also CPP could be used here.
